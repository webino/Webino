Dispatch Lock [**TODO**]
========================

It is possible to lock / unlock the application from a server dispatch. That means after locking application dispatch
it will wait to unlock for continue to finish the request.

.. code-block:: php

  $app->get(DispatchLock::class)->lock();

  $app->get(DispatchLock::class)->unlock();
