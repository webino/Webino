Webino Skeleton Application
===========================

.. contents::

The application is basically a configuration and an execution code. The configuration is cached, if enabled so,
and could be modified until application is fully bootstrapped.

For standard applications it's best to use the Webinoâ„¢ Skeleton Application.

.. note::
    See ``examples/skeleton-application/`` directory.


Application Index File
======================

The application object is created, bootstrapped and dispatched in the index file.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php // index.php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $app = Webino::application()->bootstrap();
    $app->dispatch();



Application Configuration
=========================

Application is configured in the OOP style, so instead of writing an array we are using config features.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php // config/application.php

    use WebinoAppLib\Feature as AppFeature;
    use WebinoConfigLib\Feature as ConfigFeature;

    return Webino::config([
        new ConfigFeature\Log,
        new ConfigFeature\FirePhpLog,
        new ConfigFeature\ConfigCacheEnabled,
        new AppFeature\FilesystemCache,

        (new MyCustomFeature)
            ->setAnything(),
    ]);


Directory Structure
===================

- ``<application-name>/`` *The application root directory.*

  - ``config/`` *Configuration files directory.*

    - ``autoload/`` *Autoloaded configuration files directory. VCS ignore local configs.*

      - ``local.php.dist`` *Predefined local config, handy for a package development.*

  - ``data/`` *Data files directory, archives.*

    - ``cache/`` *Cached files directory.*

    - ``extra/`` *Extra files directory.*

    - ``import/`` *Imported files directory.*

    - ``log/`` *Logger files directory, requires scheduled rotate.*

    - ``private/`` *Private files directory, private uploaded files.*

    - ``release/`` *Release specific files directory.*

  - ``public/`` *Public files directory, web server root.*

    - ``index.php`` *Public entry point.*

    - ``pipe.php`` *Asynchronous entry point.*

    - ``robots.txt`` *Search engine crawler configuration file*

    - ``assets/`` *Public assets directory.*

    - ``exported/`` *Temporary exported files directory.*

    - ``mail/`` *Temporary mail inbox.*

    - ``resized/`` *Private resized images directory.*

    - ``sessions/`` *Sessions directory.*


Dispatch Lock [**TODO**]
========================

It is possible to lock / unlock the application from a server dispatch. That means after locking application dispatch
it will wait to unlock for continue to finish the request.

.. code-block:: php

  $app->get(DispatchLock::class)->lock();

  $app->get(DispatchLock::class)->unlock();
