Webino™ is a platform for creating quality and modular web applications.

It is built on [PHP](http://php.net/) with [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/)
and other useful open-source packages.


## Goals

The main goal of Webino™ is to be a platform for high quality, modular and scalable web applications. Providing tools
for easing development, testing and building processes. Including documentation about continuous integration
and continuous delivery.

- High quality code

  - Classes must be short, prefer composition over inheritance. Use PSR-2, OOP, design-patterns and refactoring.

- Modular

  - Modules can override each others configuration thus it influences the resulting effect.

- Configurable

  - Everything must be configurable, even the templates rendering.

- Low coupling

  - The computing code must be separated to a routines emitting events and listeners.

- Testable

  - Testing is so easy that it is the first place you want to start typing.

- Scalable

  - It is built on PHP.

- Deliverable

  - Continuous integration development and continuous delivery of minimized code.   


## Technologies

- Inversion of Control
- Dependency Injection
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Event Emitting \ Listening
