Webino™ is a platform for creating quality and modular web applications.

It is built on [PHP](http://php.net/) with [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
and other useful open-source packages.

- Examples: [demo.webino.org](http://demo.webino.org) `Powered by Heroku`
- Documentation: [docs.webino.org](http://docs.webino.org) `Powered by GitHub Pages`

## Goals

The main goal of Webino™ is to be a platform for high quality, modular and scalable web applications. Providing tools
for rapid development, testing and building processes. Including support for continuous integration
and continuous delivery.

- **High quality code**

  - Classes must be short, prefer composition over inheritance. Use PSR-2, OOP, design-patterns and refactoring.

- **Configurable**

  - Everything must be configurable, even the templates rendering.
  
- **Modular architecture**

  - Modules can override each others configuration influencing the resulting effect.

- **Low coupling**

  - The computing code must be separated into routines emitting events and listeners.

- **Testable**

  - Testing must be so easy that it will be the first place you want to start typing code.

- **Scalable**

  - It is built on PHP.

- **Deliverable**

  - Continuous integration development and continuous delivery of minimized code.   

## Requirements

- [PHP 7.1](http://php.net)
- Web server: [Apache](https://www.apache.org) | [NGINX](https://nginx.org) [TODO]
- Database: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) [TODO] | [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org) [TODO] | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) [TODO] `optional`

## Architecture

- Inversion of Control
